I am a Research and Teaching Associate (Remote) with Prof. [Liu Fan's](https://fun-gene.github.io) group at Naif Arab University for Security Sciences ([NAUSS](https://nauss.edu.sa/en-us/Pages/default.aspx)), Riyadh. My work focuses on cutting-edge research in DNA-based facial recognition and forensic genetics while contributing to the development of advanced course materials. By integrating DNA phenotyping with computer vision, I aim to revolutionize forensic investigations and enhance identification accuracy.

I earned my PhD in Bioinformatics from the National Genomics Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics([BIG](http://english.big.cas.cn/)), Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CAS](https://english.cas.cn/)), and the China National Center for Bioinformation ([CNCB](https://www.cncb.ac.cn/?lang=en)), under the guidance of Prof. [Zhang Zhang](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/people/zhang-zhang). My doctoral research specialized in statistical modeling of toxicogenomics data, where I designed computational tools and machine learning algorithms to uncover insights from complex biological datasets.

Before my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Assistant at the Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Statistics, University of Rajshahi ([RU](https://www.ru.ac.bd/)), Bangladesh. I also completed my MSc and BSc in Statistics at Rajshahi University, equipping me with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, multi-omics data analysis, and bioinformatics, which remain integral to my research pursuits.
